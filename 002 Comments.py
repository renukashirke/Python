# We use comments to add notes to our code. Good comments explain the how's and
# why's, not what the code does. That should be reflected in the code itself. Use
# comments to add reminders to yourself or other developers, or also explain your
# assumptions and the reasons you’ve written code in a certain way.

# This is a comment, and it won’t get executed.
# Our comments can be multiple lines.
